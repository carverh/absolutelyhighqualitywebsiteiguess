  This picture describes how you feel when you fake a smile for a school photo.
  My state of mind was probably "I want to go home" when this picture was taken.
  When this picture was taken it was summer so I didn't want to go back to school.
  I will probably use thought bubbles with my thoughts in it.</p>

  <p>
    This is a lowpoly picture of me. It is based on my 2020 school photo. Added to it is a crude drawing of a cloud (thinking
    bubble) with a sun, clouds, and house. The name of this work is either <code>img/poly.png</code>, <code>file:///home/carver/Documents/poly.png</code>,
    <code>, or <code>https://carverh.github.io/absolutelyhighqualitywebsiteiguess/img/poly.png</code> depending on where it is located.

    I made this using a scanner, GIMP, and lowpoly creation software. I scanned my school photo, then I lowpoly'd it, then I resized and
    cleaned it up using GIMP and converted it to PNG and JPG.

   The message of my work is how I feel going back to school. No more waking up at 12pm, no more sun which I stay inside for,
   no more gaming. All of that is lost. This work says a lot about our society in my honest opinion. <abbr title="Sarcasm">
    It shows the pain and suffering students have to go through when they go back to school, in a cycle which lasts 12 years</abbr>

    My goal was to make this artpiece in <a href="https://templeos.org/">TempleOS</a> due to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPV4yW_JI8">unique art style</a>.
    However, I did not successfully do this because of many issues. First was that it turns out that 640x480 is a very bad resolution to edit a picture at.
    It also turns out that the VGA 16-color pallate has only 6 colors that can reasonably be used for skin and hair (BLACK, WHITE, LTGRAY, DKGRAY, YELLOW, BROWN)
    with WHITE, LTGRAY, and DKGRAY all being shades of BLACK, and YELLOW being the bright shade of BROWN. Even with dithering which brought the color count up, it just looked
    really bad. Also, there were outlines that couldn't be removed and moving a point was slow and required mouse skills I don't have.
    I should have seen this coming when I tried to use image editing software designed by an insane person.</p>
  <p>I leaned that I should not use image editing softwaer designed by insane people and instead use the supperior software, mspaint.exe, specifically the
    Windows 2000 and Windows 7 versions.</p>
