  <h2>emotion</h2>
<p>
  This picture describes how you feel when you fake a smile for a school photo.
  My state of mind was probably "I want to go home" when this picture was taken.
  When this picture was taken it was summer so I didn't want to go back to school.
  I will probably use thought bubbles with my thoughts in it.</p>
