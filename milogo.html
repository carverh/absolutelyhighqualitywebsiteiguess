<h2>Artist's Statement</h2>
<p>
The logos I have made are very minimalistic. The first one is the letter mu and the letter iota put together.
These letters spell out MI which stands for Mercer Island. The color used is Maroon (#800000) and Grey (#666666).
The font used for the first logo is Times New Roman.
The second one is maroon and spells out MI which also stands for Mercer Island. It is similar to the old-old
district logo. The font used for the second one is Magneto Bold. I used Adobe Illustrator to make these logos.
Most school logos are generic, these two aren't. MISD is not generic, neither should it's logo be. There are
no clich√© books, lightbulbs, or apples; just text. This is a very unique logo.
