<h2>Describe</h2>
<p>
This picture contains a landscape in the background. It is just before noon. It is realistic. It is horizontally designed with a contemporary modern design. There is a car going on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vrEljMfXYo">Country Roads</a> probably to go on vacation.
</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>
It is curved and smudgey but thin lines. The colors are greenish warm because it is supposed to represent nature. It has a 2D paralax view with many l&nbsp;a&nbsp;y&nbsp;e&nbsp;r&nbsp;s. The mountains and car pull your attention. The car is more thin lines than the nature does. The nature has more blurry lines.
</p>
<h2>Interpret</h2>
<p>
The artwork is about trying to force people to go to the inferior land of <sub>oregon</sub>. The artist is saying that Oregon good. The mood is joyful. The artists wants you to see the mountains, landscapes and """beauty""" of Oregon. The artist wants people to think about going to Oregon on vacation and spend some money in oReGoN as well and not only because there is no sales tax.
</p>
<p>
If I was to write a story about this <del>jpeg</del> <ins>png</ins> I would say this. The picture is infact not about going to OREGON (hell) but instead trying to escape OREGON. Oregon is like the Sirens in γρεεκ mythology. It looks nice but will kill you if you don't escape. So Chad and Veronica (the people in the car) are trying to escape OREGONe before their mitochondria stop producing ATP. They tried to escape to Idaho but they realized it is just as bad as OREgoN so they have to re-enter Oregon. They are speeding trying to escape Oregon to get to <span style="font-family:serif">Washington</span> which is chad (like Chad). HOWEVER, they will most likely not survive the trip as they will probably catch on fire due to one of Oregon's many wild fires.

<h2>Judge</h2>
<p>
The best part of the work is the mountains. They are very pretty. The strengths of the work are the nature and the mountains. In my opinion, the main weekness of the work is the car. It looks out of place and the people inside of it (Chad and Veronica) are basic. <b>Also I would like to mention that they are not wearing seatbelts: <img src="img/potw1b.png" height="100" width="100" alt="h">. UNSAFE 0/10</b> THIS IS UNEPIC. This work needs to be recalled because it is an obvious safety hazard!!!!
