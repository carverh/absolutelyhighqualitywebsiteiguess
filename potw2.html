<p><i>Early Leaning Counting Set by Banksy</i></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
There is a white background. There is a white, rusting truck. The truck has a blue tarp for walls.
The truck is most likely metal. There are people next to the truck and the door of the truck is open.
A woman is handing a baby to a man standing in the truck. There are many people of different professions and ages.
The people are frowning.
</p>
<h2>Analyze</h2>
<p>
It is a real photograph. Not a painting. The materials used are likely hardwood for the people. The wheels are probably plastic. The windows are most likely plastic. The tarp is made of a fabric of some sort. The truck looks warn out. The people are 2d block figures.
</p>
<h2>Interpret</h2>
<p>
This artwork is telling the story of an illegal human trafficking operation. You can see that 10 people are being trafficked in the United States from Mexico. The people are not happy because they are being held against their will. There are two people in the back, a corrupt police officer who is keeping the victims inline. There is also a miner who is holding a pickaxe. If anyone is out of line he will hit them with the pickaxe. It is not known what will happen to these people after they enter the United States, many will become domestic servants.
</p>
<h2>Judgement</h2>
<p>
While the truck is very well designed, it is missing a license plate which gives hope that the human trafficking victims will be saved from enslavement because of a state trooper pulling him over for missing a license plate. Banksy should have realized that criminals are smarter than this and that they would never forget to <del>steal</del> <ins>acquire</ins> a license plate before going on a high stakes human trafficking operation. Also, I am pretty sure that Mexico doesn't look like a white void, but I have never been there so how would I know what it looks like? I know for a fact that Wyoming doesn't exist (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56uSDQECrRQ">Garfield told me so</a>) so why couldn't Mexico not exist either. Overall i give it a íÅè out of ten.
