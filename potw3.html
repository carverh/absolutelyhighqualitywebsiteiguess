<h1>TWA: New York</h1>
<p><i>By David Klein</i></p>
</center>
<big>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This is a very abstract piece of art. It uses <span style="font-family:sans-serif">sans-serif</span> font instead of serif
or <tt>monospace</tt> font. The font is also <span style="font-family:sans-serif"><b><i>Bold and Italic</i></b></span> but more
italic. There are a lot of rectangles and vibrant <font color="red">c</font><font color="green">o</font><font color="darkgray">l</font><font color="magenta">o</font><font color="orange">r</font>s.
There are sparkles and for some reason a plane looking like <tt>AA Flight 11</tt>.
</big>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>
The lines are not very horizontal but are more diagonal. The sparkles are many different colors. It looks like it was
made in mspaint. There is a building in the background. The lines at the bottom and multicolo<strike>u</strike>red and c<sup>u</sup><small>r</small><sub>v</sub><small>y</small>.
</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>
I think it is <b>very</b> insensitive for this 1950s artist to have a plane in a picture of New York. There are two buildings next to
the plane. This is obviously a reference to the <i>Twin Towers</i> which were destroyed on <date>September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2019</date>.
More evidence for a government conspiracy to cover up 9/11. The artist was trying to tell us something 61 years ago.
There is obviously something going on. 2001-1958=43 years. 43 is a prime number. 1943. In 1943 FDR leaves for Casablanca, Morocco.
Morocco is a country in Africa. Africa is a song written by 1982 by Toto. Toto spelled backwards is otot. There are
infact 4 words in "New York Fly TWA" and 4 letters in "otot". This is unbelievable. WHAT MORE? IT TURNS OUT THAT TWA CEASED OPERATIONS ON <date>December 1<sup>st</sup>, 2001</date>. This is too obvious to be a coincidence. It must be that
bigguv<sup>TM</sup> has been trying to silence David Klein and TWA to keep them from telling the truth about NIne/Eleven.
what more? sqrt(9) = 3. How many sides on a triangle? THREE. Illuminati Confirmed.

<h2>Judgement Time</h2>
<p>
The art is really ugly it looks like someone made it in TuxPaint in fact I remade the entire picture in TuxPaint:
</p>
<img src="img/potw3a.png" height="50%" width="50%">
<p>
The snowflakes are just brushed on like a stamp. The plane is an
obvious overlay. And the rectangles are the worst part. There is no rhyme or reason for them. Because of this I hath decideth to
giveth this pictureth a <sup>9<sup>th</sup></sup>/<sub>11<sup>th</sup></sub>.
