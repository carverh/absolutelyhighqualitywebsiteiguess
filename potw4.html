<h1>Lammersville Unified School District Logo</h1>
<p><i>By accentdesign</i></p>
</marquee>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
There is a white background. The logo is very small compared the surrounding background. The colors used are <font color="green">green</font>,
<font color="orange">yellow</font> and <font color="blue">blue</font>. It is a very complex logo. It has gradients as well. The font is
TrajanÂ® Pro 3 Semi Bold. The art is cartoonish in nature and has simple graphics making up a complex picture. There is a bookriver, two mountains, three students, four birds, five turbines, the sun and a house. If I was to see the logo I would think it was an energy company with the wind turbines, sun and river.
</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>
The art is cartoonish, uses a lot of gradients, uses layers and outlines. The image is vector and not <span style="text-rendering:optimizeSpeed;font-family:fixedsys,monospace">raster</span>. The sky is white for some reason to match with the background.
</p>
<h2>Interpret</h2>
<p>
This is obviously not trying to be a school logo but is instead trying to convince children that the world is flat instead of teaching the obviously false
notion that the earth is round. The sun surrounding the earth is a display of a flat-earth style firmament as aposed to a globe-earth firmament.
It is a welcome change for this district to be teaching <b><i>TRUE</i></b> and <b><i>HONEST</i></b> flat earth theory.
However, there are inaccuracies to this picture. The birds, which the artist meant to be aliens from <i>Planet X</i>, shouldn't be there because ain't no Planet X coming cuz ain't no space cuz ain't not globe earth.

<h2>Judge</h2>
<p>
The logo doesn't scale well at all. The sky shouldn't be white. It is way too complex. It looks like a textbook publishere/energy company logo instead of a school logo.
There is no point to having <strike>birds</strike> aliens from Planet X because they are only 8 pixels tall and 8 pixels wide. This is what 8px looks like: <span style="display:inline-block;width:8px;height:8px;background:black;"></span>. If it looks big pull out a 90s CRT monitor and view it because for some reason, CSS enlarges pixels. It's very small. They should have just made it simpler. I give it 8px/2vw.
