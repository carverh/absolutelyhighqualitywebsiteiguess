<h2>Interpret</h2>
<p>
Παυλ and Πετροσ were on an expedition to a previously unknown planet. There had been reports of strange energy
bursts coming from the planet. The trip to this unknown planet, named Σ-25, took around 10 months. When the
explorers finally arived they saw a femoid with green hair crying. They asked her what was wrong. She responded:</p>
<blockquote>
όπως ήταν στην αρχή και πάντα θα ήταν ένας κόσμος χωρίς τέλος
</blockquote>
<p>The explorers were shocked by this statement, not knowing how to respond to this wise wisdom.</p>
<h2>Judgement</h2>
<p>
Judgement time. I think it is very cool and good picture. The art is very well done and the color choice is very nice
and cool and okay and good. I giveth this picture a á/10.
