<p><i>Mercer Island School District Logo by person who made the logo</i></p>
</center>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
It has a maroon foreground with a white background. There is a mountain
and a bridge. The mountain is likely Mt. Rainier.
There are trees which look like a copper nail has been struck through them.
There is some nuclear snow on the ground and lake water has become solid and there are dead birds on it.
The words MERCER ISLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT (or MERCER ISLAND DISTRICT SCHOOL).
</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>
I am not sure if there is any shading going on because the JPEG quality is so low. It either can be shading or <span style="filter:blur(1px)">JPEG artifacts</span>. The drawing looks traced and mercer island only takes up a small purpose of the logo. The perspective isn't even from mercer island. It is overly complex and difficult to draw and likely doesn't scale well.
</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>
It was April 20th, 20XX. Nuclear war has devastated Western Washington specifically King County, Washington. The trees are all dead. Nuclear ash covers the ground. Nuclear ash floats through to the air. The 520 bridge has started to sink into the water. There are no confirmed survivors. Everyone's dead.
</p>
<h2>Judgement</h2>
It doesn't scale, it's too complex, it's imposible to draw, it's ugly, no one even knows that it's the school district logo and it has been ran through a JPEG deep fryer. I give it <span id="num"></span>/10.
