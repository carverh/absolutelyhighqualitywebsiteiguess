<h2>artist's statement</h2>
<p>
This is a tonal drawing of Mt. Athos. The work is untitled. The subject mater is one of the monasteries at Mt. Athos and a dove.
I used Adobe Illustrator to make this piece as well as a computer. I used many layers to get a 3d feel. I used gradients to do the sky and the water.
I attempted to use shading on the sides of the structure. The big idea of my picture is to show the beauty of Mt. Athos. My goals were to create a detailed
drawing of Mt. Athos. I could not complete the front face of the monastery because it was was very complicated. I learned that trying to do a tonal drawing of
12th century architecture is very difficult.
